Researcher: Okay, hi, thanks for being part of the study. Today we’re looking at a food inventory app that helps you track what you have in your kitchen, check expiry dates, generate recipe suggestions, and find food donation options for surplus items.
The app is actually supposed to be a mobile app, but deployment was crashing—so all we have today is my laptop’s front camera. It might be a bit harder to get a proper scan on the food, but that’s okay.
Before we begin, I want to confirm your consent to take part. Participation is voluntary—you can stop at any time or skip any question. Your responses will be anonymous, and no identifying information will be used in reports or publications. Do you consent to participate in this study?
P5: Yeah.
Researcher: Okay, cool. So for your first task, I would like you to input these items into the inventory, and I’ll tell you three ways to do it. First, you can go to the camera scanner, scan your stuff, and press the Snapshot button. Second, you can use a thumbs-up gesture to do the exact same thing. Third, you can just access the inventory, and there’s an Add Item button in it. You can put these in any way you like — just experiment and play around with it. Tell me how it goes and think aloud while you’re doing it.
P5: Okay.
Researcher: You could try the camera detector first if you’re unsure. By the way, my trackpad doesn’t work, so you’ll need to use the mouse.
P5: Okay, what do I do?
Researcher: You can put the thumbs up—hold on, there you go. Now enter the item details.
P5: Cool. The thumbs up thing is a nice touch, it makes the experience quite fun. 
Researcher: Do you see your stuff here? Wait—that might be items added from before, I forgot to delete them. If you scroll down, you should see yours.
P5: Yeah, here it is. I found mine.
Researcher: Great. Now try adding the other two items—the bread and the eggs. You can use any method you want.
P5: Okay. Eggs are getting detected.. and bread, eggs… wow. How did it get eggs from that? The scanning aspect makes this a lot easier, especially after a grocery run, I could just scan the items from the camera instead of manual input.
Researcher: Do you see your eggs in the inventory?
P5: Yeah.
Researcher: What do you think so far?
P5: It’s good—pretty responsive.
Researcher: Nice. How do you feel about the model’s accuracy so far?
P5: I guess it’s good. Let’s try scanning the bread.
Researcher: (laughs) As you say that, it immediately misregisters—looks like it detected chicken breast from somewhere.
P5: (laughs) Yeah.
Researcher: You can delete it if you want in the post-scanning customizable form.
P5: Okay, deleted. I like how customizable my food database is.
Researcher: Now, I’d like you to explore the “Your Kitchen” page. You’ll see some expiry info and different sections. How do you think that might be helpful—or redundant?
P5: It’s helpful. It tells you which items should be consumed by their expiry date, and that you shouldn’t use them after.
Researcher: What about the “Check Before Use” category?
P5: That’s for items that might still be okay even after expiry, right?
Researcher: Exactly.
P5: Yeah, that’s good—it tells you when food might still be safe to eat even after expiry, so you don’t have to throw it away immediately.
Researcher: Great. There are also some edit and delete actions. When do you think those might come into play?
P5: Yeah, I like how customizable my food database is. Maybe when I’ve used some of an item—like if I’ve used one or two mushrooms, I could use the edit feature to decrease the quantity.
Researcher: Makes sense. So, looking at all this food in your pantry, how would you plan to use it all?
P5: I’d probably go to “Generate Recipes.”
Researcher: Without that feature, would you have any ideas on what to make?
P5: Not really, I’m not a good cook. This helps a lot for making meals with what I already have.
Researcher: (laughs) Fair enough. What would you do if you had a surplus of items?
P5: If I had too much food, I’d invite people over.
Researcher: So, share it. That’s actually something the app tries to encourage. Scroll to the bottom of “Generate Recipes.”
P5: “Donate Your Food.” Nice. I didn’t even know donating was an option, and this app even includes the places I can go to if I ever want to donate.
Researcher: What do you think so far?
P5: It’s pretty good—all the features are well implemented, apart from that chicken breast misdetection.
Researcher: (laughs) Fair. Okay, just a few closing questions. How did using the app influence the way you think about food waste?
P5: It helps me figure out whether food is still good even after the expiry date, so I don’t have to throw it away immediately.
Researcher: So it makes you think more before discarding food.
P5: Yeah, and it helps me know what to do with some of the stuff I already have.
Researcher: Did you learn anything new from using the app?
P5: I always thought you had to throw food away after expiry, but I guess that’s not always the case.
Researcher: Were there any aspects that were easy or difficult to use?
P5: Most of it was easy to use.
Researcher: Any challenges while testing it?
P5: The detector sometimes misidentified human faces as food items.
Researcher: Got it—some inaccuracies in detection. Any obstacles that might stop you from using the app regularly?
P5: Just the model accuracy. If it’s not accurate enough, I wouldn’t use it. But if it’s good, I don’t see any other issue.
Researcher: Do you think the recipe generation and donation features would work for you in real life?
P5: Yeah, I think so. 
Researcher: Any suggestions or feedback?
P5: Not really. I enjoyed it.
Researcher: That’s great. Thanks—you can just fill out the post-task survey now.
P5: Okay.
