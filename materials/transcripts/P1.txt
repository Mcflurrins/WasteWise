Researcher: Hi, thank you for being part of this study. We're looking at a food inventory app that helps you track what you have in your kitchen, generate recipe suggestions, find food donation options for surplus items, and monitor expiry dates.
This app is supposed to be a mobile app, but deployment kept crashing on me—so today we’ll just use my laptop’s front camera. Heads up, it might be a bit harder to get a proper scan of the food. I’d like you to answer the questions as if this was a mobile product.
P1: Sure.
Researcher: Before we begin, I just want to confirm your consent to take part. Participation is voluntary, and you can stop at any time or skip any question. Your responses will be anonymous, and no identifying information will be used in reports or publications. Do you consent to participate in this study?
P1: I do consent.
Researcher: Okay, cool. So for your first task, I would like you to input these items into the inventory, and I’ll tell you three ways to do it. First, you can go to the camera scanner, scan your stuff, and press the Snapshot button. Second, you can use a thumbs-up gesture to do the exact same thing. Third, you can just access the inventory, and there’s an Add Item button in it. You can put these in any way you like — just experiment and play around with it. Tell me how it goes and think aloud while you’re doing it.
P1: Okay. So I have black pepper.
Researcher: Great, you have black pepper.
P1: All right, cool. Let me add some more items—eggs, and then also black pepper manually. I can set the expiry date too, right?
Researcher: Yes, you can set the expiry date however you like, just to simulate.
P1: Okay, first one. I’d say I store my bread in the fridge.
Researcher: What are you thinking as you enter these items?
P1: Turns out my eggs were past their expiry date, but my bread is still fresh. My black pepper is also fine since it expires in 2026. The app displays all that correctly.
Researcher: Good. I’d like you to explore more of the features. For example, check the expiry info button, add or edit items, etc.
P1: Okay. I can check expiry info for each item and see the storage and safety notes. I can also view the “use by” date and storage recommendations. For example, the app says chicken breast should be cooked to 165°F to be safe. I can also delete items if I run out, or update them—for example, if I forgot to note that the bread is gluten-free, I can change it.
Researcher: Great. It can also generate recipes—but let’s hold off for a second. Try deleting something, like fresh tomatoes.
P1: Done—it deleted fine.
Researcher: Perfect. What do you think of the expiry info you see? Is it different for each item, and what does it tell you?
P1: Each item has different expiry info. For example, spices like thyme and black pepper both show expiry statuses saying they’re usually still good after expiry, so it’s fine to use them. Bread, though, says it’s typically good for 3–5 days after expiry if there’s no mold. So yeah, app’s listing out items by priority of whether they’re expiring soon, already expired or still fresh. It also lets you know if the already expired items could possibly be salvaged, like, kind of prompts you to think for yourself and look for signs of expiry before just throwing it out.
Researcher: After seeing your items here, how would you use up what’s in your kitchen, and what would you do with any surplus?
P1: I’d probably meal prep with my fresh ingredients. For example, I could make black pepper chicken with bread on the side, or add more spices for variety.
Researcher: Nice. To help with meal planning, you can try the “Generate Recipes” tool—it matches recipes to your pantry ingredients. How are you finding that feature?
P1: It really helps me figure out what to eat without having to spend a lot of time googling and searching on youtube. For example, it recommended I make shakshuka—it’s that tomato-based dish topped with eggs. It matched my ingredients and showed the exact steps to cook it. It also has dietary tags—like if a dish is vegetarian. That helps if I’m serving other people. It even suggested chicken fried rice too.
Researcher: Great. Now, look at the third feature—the one showing food donation locations for surplus food. What do you think of this feature, and when do you think it might be useful?
P1: Maybe if I host an event and have leftovers, I could use this info to find donation spots—like charity centers or community fridges. 
Researcher: That makes sense. All right, that’s all for the task portion. I’d like you to fill out the post-use survey I sent.
P1: Okay.
Researcher: Thank you. Now just a few closing questions. How did using the app influence how you think about food waste?
P1: It helped me realize that some foods are still safe to eat after their expiry date and taught me how to look for signs of expiry with my own five senses, like looking out for mold or weird smells.
Researcher: Would you say it increased your awareness of tracking inventory in your kitchen? Did you learn anything else?
P1: Yes, definitely. It helped me see what foods I have, their expiry dates, and keep track of what I’ve bought. It also reminded me that I could donate surplus food instead of letting it go to waste.
Researcher: Thanks for your valuable input. Did you find any parts of the app easy or difficult to use?
P1: Everything was easy to use. I didn’t have any trouble. Maybe the camera system still needs a bit of improvement, but that’s all.
Researcher: What challenges or obstacles might prevent you from using the app regularly?
P1: Maybe if I don’t have mobile data, since it’s web-based right now. If it were an offline mobile app, that’d be much better.
Researcher: Any suggestions or feedback for improving the app?
P1: Maybe improve the computer vision detection and expand the food dataset. Also, add more donation locations and show nutritional info like calories or protein for each recipe.
Researcher: Excellent feedback. Thank you for participating in the study. Any final thoughts?
P1: This would really help me save my money because the app reminds me to think twice before I throw out expired food. It'd be great if it could scan the macros of the food and display them on the matched recipes too. 
Researcher: All right, thank you!
