# WasteWise - Responsible Home Inventory Management with Computer Vision
## Save your Wallet, and our Planet!

WasteWise is a high-fidelity prototype of a website that utilizes computer vision to easily keep track of inventory and when they will soon expire. 

This repository contains WasteWise's source code itself and results from our pilot evaluation of this prototype. 

Here's a tease of what it looks like, taken from the project documentation markdown.

### How to Navigate this Repository
#### 1. PLEASE Skim the Project Documentation
This is the central deliverable of this repository, consisting of quantitative and qualitative analysis of our pilot evaluation regarding WasteWise, its problem introduction, and its features, along with all the resources and citations used in this study. It's really cool I promise and you can probably skim it in under a minute.

#### 2. Watch the Project Presentation
This is a 5-minute TL;DR of the Project Documentation if you're not into reading. 

#### 3. See deliverables in the ```materials``` folder
My quantitative analysis Jupyter Notebook and its corresponding survey sources are attached in the ```quant_analysis``` folder. 

Transcripts for qualitative analysis are attached in the ```transcripts``` folder, with the resulting thematic analysis in here: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJ0Daq3M=/?share_link_id=762044370534 

Source code is in ```HCI_prototype```.

### Note on PDF generation

This repository automatically generates PDF files from markdown files to create the a nice version of your assessment documents.

Sometimes this process doesn't work the way you might expect.

In particular, due to how the Pandoc tool generates a PDF (using LaTeX), images float to where they fit in the document. If you have a lot of images in one place, they may float to the end of the document.
